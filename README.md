# GextonPython-Intern_Task11
The program will convert temperatures between three units: Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K). The user will input the temperature value, the unit they want to convert from, and the unit they want to convert to. The program will then output the converted temperature.

# Temperature Converter

This is a simple Python-based temperature conversion program developed as part of **Task #11** under the supervision of **Sir Muhammad Arham MH**. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Features

- Convert between:
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
  - Celsius ↔ Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin
- Input validation for temperature values and units
- Clear and readable result display
- Modular structure using functions

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - A numeric temperature value
   - The unit to convert **from** (C, F, K)
   - The unit to convert **to** (C, F, K)
2. The program calculates the result using the appropriate conversion formula.
3. The result is printed with two decimal places and unit notation.

## Example

```

## Temperature Converter

Enter the temperature value: 100
Convert from (C, F, K): C
Convert to (C, F, K): F
Result: 100.0°C is 212.00°F

```

## File Structure

```

temperature\_converter.py   # Main Python file containing the program
README.md                  # This documentation file

````

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing `temperature_converter.py`.
4. Run the program:

```bash
